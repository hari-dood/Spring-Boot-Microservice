# Microservices Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a microservices-based system for managing orders, products, inventory, payments, and notifications. Each service has specific responsibilities and communicates with other services through a message broker to ensure seamless functionality.

## Services

### 1. **Order Service**
- **Responsibility**: Manages order creation, status updates, and tracks the lifecycle of an order.
- **Communication**:
    - **Product Service**: Fetches product details (e.g., name, price) for the order.
    - **Inventory Service**: Verifies stock availability for the ordered products.
    - **Payment Service**: Initiates payment processing.
    - **Message Broker**: After order creation, sends a message to **Payment Service** for payment processing.

### 2. **Product Service**
- **Responsibility**: Manages the product catalog, including adding, updating, and deleting products.
- **Communication**:
    - **Order Service**: Provides product details during order creation.
    - **Inventory Service**: Sends updates to stock levels after a product is modified.
    - **Message Broker**: Sends messages to **Inventory Service** and other services about product updates.

### 3. **Inventory Service**
- **Responsibility**: Tracks and manages stock levels for products.
- **Communication**:
    - **Order Service**: Confirms product availability based on stock levels.
    - **Message Broker**: Publishes stock updates when inventory levels change (e.g., after an order is placed or canceled).
    - **Notification Service**: Sends stock-related alerts (e.g., low stock warnings).

### 4. **Payment Service**
- **Responsibility**: Handles payment processing via third-party payment gateways.
- **Communication**:
    - **Order Service**: Receives payment requests after order confirmation.
    - **Message Broker**: Upon payment success, sends messages to **Inventory Service** (for stock updates) and **Notification Service** (for notifications).

### 5. **Notification Service**
- **Responsibility**: Sends notifications via email/SMS to users and admins (e.g., order confirmations, payment confirmations, inventory alerts).
- **Communication**:
    - **Message Broker**: Listens for events from other services to trigger notifications (e.g., payment success, order status, low stock).

## Communication Flow

1. **Order Creation**:
    - The user places an order.
    - **Order Service** fetches product details from **Product Service**.
    - **Order Service** checks stock availability from **Inventory Service**.
    - **Order Service** sends a message to **Payment Service** to process payment.

2. **Payment Processing**:
    - **Payment Service** processes the payment.
    - Upon success, **Payment Service** sends a message to **Inventory Service** to update stock.
    - **Payment Service** also triggers a notification through **Notification Service**.

3. **Inventory Management**:
    - **Inventory Service** manages stock levels.
    - Once an order is placed, **Inventory Service** reduces stock levels.
    - If stock is low, **Inventory Service** publishes an alert message to the **Notification Service** to notify the admin.

4. **Notification**:
    - **Notification Service** listens to events (e.g., order confirmation, payment success, low stock).
    - Sends notifications to the user (e.g., order confirmation) and to the admin (e.g., low stock alert).

## Message Broker Communication

- **Message Broker** (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) plays a central role in the communication between services.
- **Where to Send**: Services publish events to the message broker.
- **Who to Send**: Services subscribe to relevant messages:
    - **Order Service** sends a message to **Payment Service**.
    - **Payment Service** sends a message to **Inventory Service**.
    - **Inventory Service** sends a message to **Notification Service**.
- **How to Send**: Services use the message broker's API to send and receive messages asynchronously.

## Inventory Management

- **Stock Updates**: The **Inventory Service** tracks the stock level of products.
- When an order is placed, **Inventory Service** decreases the stock.
- If stock is low, **Inventory Service** sends a message to the **Notification Service** for alerting admins.

## Notifications

- **Order Confirmation**: After order creation, **Notification Service** sends an order confirmation to the user.
- **Payment Confirmation**: Once payment is successful, **Notification Service** sends a payment success notification.
- **Low Stock Alerts**: **Inventory Service** triggers alerts to admins when stock levels are low.

## Summary

- The system is designed using microservices to maintain scalability, flexibility, and independent service development.
- Communication between services is achieved asynchronously using a message broker to handle events and trigger actions.
- The **Order Service**, **Payment Service**, **Inventory Service**, **Product Service**, and **Notification Service** interact seamlessly to process orders, update stock, handle payments, and notify users and admins.
